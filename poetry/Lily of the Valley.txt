Lily of the Valley

// make this to be the most ambitious piece of poetry I've ever made.

Oft they leave your presence
Wander the trace of one's face
Alongside this delicate subtle silhouette
Twas, a melancholy of its nature

Twice of eyes paints a thousand lies
In the demure sea they rained, it dries
Lost in the deep sweet reverie
Yet still within its worldly fantasy

Speak of what wants to swallow
Hear of none needs to face
Mute of all shout to vow
Frail of sorrow to embrace

Half the moon turns three sun
Sweeping faces from its frown
Made lose all sense of you'd esteem
What thee could see but grey all seemed

Mother tells a tale but true avail
Gales of earth had for Roman to prevail
Of edge cliff thou come sure near
Blindly running mere surface clear

Thrice seats under the blaze of eve
Some words were utterly spoken
Same deep wave hits back with relieve
How graceful shall two hearts were open

Hand a verselet on the wheels
Your steps were out all a pair
Great flame burns one euphoric thrills
Died fleetingly hence face His flare

Last valentine bleed thou nose
Upon her anachronic wrangle, vex it be
Lay down pale weeping willows
Afore grief chiseled stone I knee

Evanescent joy that placid pace
Spare a hand of whimsical zephyr
'Tis pleasant touch sanguine wave
Ebb tide and dive interstelllar

Saintly night fairy borns anew
Eat nought cake of yours she'd given
Not her questions empathy once threw (?flew)
Run it off slick end forgiven--

Eta Aquariids rains down the window
Flood the chaste battlefield of notion
Amidst thy most powerful weapon and lo
Let of loudest scream graven emotion

Them smile's dormant, it remains
Care not such voices was refrained
Lay on coffin dusk till down
Go too far seek what to found

Spit and lick every contigency
A travesty of our cognition
To run from one goes another
Never thought rolling black snow up the hill

Always seeing later he would open
Knowing too well the keys broken
Let it rots becomes a burden
Trough it is worse than death's omen

Lone dusts floating in this airy fuzz
For a being born amongst the stars 
How come does not 
Step in the vague storm and wonder was it truly?
An exaggeration of such expression to no grim --> sadness ?

I throw a proclivity at wraith
A quixotic, pearly gate step
Apathy radiates through faith
Faith thou whisper on pine carpets

{ future }

{ death }

Name your fear and hear you will
"For the one you trapped in, naught but a mere shadow thou made it to be.
Let off they thou can't intervene, lest it vanish with every blinks."
