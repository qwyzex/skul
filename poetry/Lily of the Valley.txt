Lily of the Valley
Ihsan Fashbir D. - 16 May 2023  

Oft they leave your presence 
Wander the trace of one's face  
Alongside this delicate subtle silhouette  
Twas, a melancholy of its nature  

Twice of eyes paints a thousand lies  
In the demure sea they rainedâ€”it dries  
Lost in the deep sweet reverie  
Yet still within its worldly fantasy  

Speak of what wants to swallow  
Hear of none needs to face  
Mute of all shout to  vow  
Frail of sorrow to embrace  

Half the moon turns three suns  
Sweeping faces from its frown  
Made lose all sense of you'd esteem  
What thee could see but grey all seemed

Mother tells a tale but true avail  
Gales of earth had for walls to prevail 
Of edge cliff thou come sure near  
Blindly running mere surface clear  

Triad seats under the blaze of eve  
Strings of words were purely spoken  
Ditto wave retrieved, vale sent breeze
Just how graceful shall twain hearts were open

Hand a verselet on the wheels  
Thy steps were out all a pair  
Great flame burns one euphoric thrills  
Died fleetingly unto His flare  

Last valentine bleed thy nose  
Upon her anachronic wrangle, vex it be  
Lay down pale weeping willows  
Afore grief chiselled stone I knee  

Evanescent joy that placid pace  
Spare a hand of whimsical zephyr  
'Tis pleasant touch sanguine wave  
Ebb tide and dive Interstellar  

Saintly night fairy born anew  
Eat naught cake of thine she'd received 
Not hen's questions empathy once threw 
Run it off slick end  forgiven 

Eta Aquariids rains down the window  
Flood the chaste battlefield of notion  
Amidst thy most powerful weapon and lo  
Let of loudest scream graven emotion  

Them smile's dormant, it remains  
Care not such voices was refrained  
Lay on coffin dusk till down  
Go too far seek what to found  

Spit and lick every contingency  
A travesty of our cognition! 
To run from one goes another   
Black snow up the hill hint unbothered 

I throw a proclivity at wraith  
A quixotic, pearly gate step  
Apathy radiates through faith  
Faith thou whisper on pine carpets  

A sycophant to clemency
Lone naive slave to sinnery
Hide of the shields of your vanity
Dreamt to brought prosperity

Sealing mountains of confession 
Seemeth to strive it open 
Let it rots becomes a burden  
Trough it, is worse than death's omen  

It sight what can't be seen 
And hold what can't be touched  
Amongst the stars thou once were born 
Amidst the void thou dance and mourn 

Gaze amore blind enigmatic ceil 
Seek answer to false questions of thee 
Exaggerate such expressions to no grim 
Bethink of the mooncalf thou art 

Lay off your clairvoyance
Embrace ones ignorance 
Sought who was once long to be 
Thou shalt virtues on the fragments of Lily

'Fraid not the sands who fleet
As thou ought to walk hereafter
The crows repose upon thee
Soon skies aflame ever after

Name your fear and hear you will 
"For the one you trapped in, naught but a mere shadow thou made it to be. 
Let off they thou can't intervene, lest it vanish with every blinks."
