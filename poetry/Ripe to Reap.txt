Ripe to Reap
Ihsan Fashbir D.  -  24 Jan 2023

Cry on, thou, for eternity
‘Tis heart of mine
Of which was blithe for such love,
For I have swore
Plunge those rose, I won’t

“Not old enough for Love
Not young enough to unsee you”
Yet ripe to reap
Erelong rot afore mist
Stand sought shore across the horizon
On the edge of divinity, I lush

Ne’er ‘til this night
True beauty for what I don’t seek
By itself came to me graceful
Benevolence of Venus herself

Thy mere presence as spring
Fill my drained-dry soul away
Bewildered with uncertainty
Is what this forlorn soul of mine has become

Fuck! Forswear one’s oath!
For if I ever sight
Thine eyes evermore
To paint mine, vapid soul

I dream, and hopes, and pray
I wish you won’t deprive
This love I sealed for times
For what I will do?
If it is not yours for the taking

Whilst the glamorous daystar
Hid beneath us, it plea!
Them luminary clusters of gases
Flourish our love, they’ll bless
