Moon Muse -- ifd 19.04.23

The moon is beautiful, isn't it?
Yes it is as you are
Doing nothing worth more when I'm with you

Trails of scent they left open
Their facade trapped under the oak leaf
No. The hummingbird fell
She bled by her eyes
Debris of her dwelling blown for--

The winds they got along
The wind, they sang a song
They asked you "Something's wrong?"
They left with no answer where you belong.
No, I've been here for too long
You wonder how come? Love?

The nature knows no men
Or did they grow its very soul
That glittering ocean was so fragile
Or was it just too powerful for a fool

"Shoot for the moon!" They say
Neither of it we can't see
Remorse swelling down your throat
Why're we standing here, let it all afloat?
The emptiness of hell is whats left for me

You, yes. Gaze it, You!
Stare onto it shimmering mists!
Maybe we'll be able to live this out of it.
God, I've heard it whisper for so long, for so far

&.

Shall we fall from the devine land he promised
Shall we are just a tear in the ocean
Shall we live on the edge of regret
Just know that I am here
I was here 
I've live
We've live
You've live
You were here
You are here
For it is true that I--

Oh, can't you realize?
I can die happy.
